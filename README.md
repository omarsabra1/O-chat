# O-chat
O-Chat is a simple chat application built with Node.js and Socket.IO.
It allows users to join chat rooms and send messages in real-time.

# Getting Started
To get started with O-Chat, you'll need to clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omarsabra1/O-chat.git
cd O-chat
npm install
```
Once you have the dependencies installed, you can start the server with:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start the server on port 3000. You can then open a web browser and navigate to 
`http://localhost:3000` to use the application.

# Usage
To use O-Chat, simply enter a username and a chat room name. 
You can then send messages in real-time and see messages from other users in the same chat room.
